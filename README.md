# The Titanic Dataset Regression Model
This project contains a jupyter notebook for analysing the data and a csv file with the dataset.
## Titanic Story
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.
One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class passengers.
## Objective
The objective was to build a regression model to predict ticket price(Fare).
## Description
In this project, I conducted analysis on the titanic dataset. I trained the dataset using a linear regression on Fare using **statsmodels**. I picked Pclass, Embarked and FamilySize as my indepent variables. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploration, visualization, statistical analysis, modeling and hypothesis testing.

In this project, I conducted analysis on the Titanic dataset. I trained the dataset using linear regression to predict the Fare using the **statsmodels** library. I selected Pclass, Embarked, and FamilySize as independent variables for the regression analysis. 
The use of statsmodels allowed for the estimation of coefficients for each independent variable, hypothesis testing of their significance, and assessment of the overall fit of the regression model. Additionally, visualizations and statistical tests were employed to further analyze the relationships between variables and interpret the results of the regression analysis.
